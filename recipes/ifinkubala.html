        <h2>Description</h2>
            
        <p>Ifinkubala are dried caterpillars, a popular and nutritious Zambian delicacy (also known as Mopane worms) rich in protein, essential amino acids, iron, and potassium, often enjoyed as a snack or served with nshima (porridge) after being rehydrated, fried with onions and tomatoes, and seasoned. They are hand-picked during the rainy season, cleaned, dried, and then prepared by soaking and frying until they reach a desired crunchy or soft texture.
