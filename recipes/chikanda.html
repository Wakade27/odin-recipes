        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>

                Chikanda is a popular,
                vegan Zambian delicacy made from ground wild orchid tubers,
                pounded peanuts, 
                and spices,
                known for its unique texture resembling polony or sausage,
                served as a snack,
                side dish with nshima,
                or celebratory food.
                Its preparation involves boiling the mixture and often baking it on top for a browned crust,
                offering plant-based protein and energy.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Chikanda (Orchid Tuber) Powder: Approximately 1 cup (250g)</li>
                    <li>Pounded Groundnuts (Peanuts): 2 to 3.5 cups (500g).</li>
                    <li>Baking Soda: 1 to 2 tablespoons (crucial for browning and thickening).</li>
                    <li>Water: 3 to 4.5 cups (or up to 1 liter).</li>
                    <li>Seasonings: Salt to taste and chili (optional).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare the Base: Mix the pounded groundnuts with water in a medium pot to form a light paste or slurry.</li>
                        <li>Initial Cooking: Place the pot on a charcoal brazier (preferred for traditional flavor) and stir continuously until the groundnut mixture is well-cooked, which takes about 10–15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Incorporate Chikanda: Gradually sprinkle the chikanda powder into the boiling groundnut paste. Stir vigorously and continuously with a wooden cooking stick to prevent lumps.</li>
                        <li>Add Thickening Agents: Dissolve the baking soda in a small amount of water and add it to the mixture along with salt and chili. The mixture will begin to thicken and darken as you stir.</li>
                        <li>Cook to Thickness: Continue stirring vigorously until the mixture is very thick and starts coming away from the sides of the pot or the cooking stick.</li>
                        <li>Baking Process: Smooth the top of the mixture. Cover the pot with a lid and place hot charcoal directly on top of the lid (turning it upside down if necessary) to create a "top-down oven" effect. Bake for roughly 30 minutes on low heat until the top is golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Cool and Slice: Remove the pot from the heat and allow the chikanda to cool completely. Once firm, turn the pot upside down to release the "loaf" onto a plate and slice it into pieces for serving.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
