    <h1>MICHOPO</h1>

        <img src="images/michopo.jpg" alt="A picture of michopo">

        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

            <p>Michopo is Zambian BBQ, typically strips of goat, beef, or chicken grilled over charcoal, seasoned simply with salt, chili, garlic, and lemon, often served with onions, and enjoyed at social gatherings with staples like nshima. To make it, marinate meat in garlic/chili, grill until smoky, and serve hot with fresh onion rings and a squeeze of lemon for that authentic, smoky flavor.</p>

            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Meat: 500g to 1kg of goat meat (preferred) or beef, cut into thin strips or bite-sized cubes.</li>
                    <li>Aromatics: 2 thumbs of fresh ginger and 5–7 cloves of garlic, minced or ground.</li>
                    <li>Seasoning: 1 tsp black pepper, salt to taste, and a pinch of chili powder (optional).</li>
                    <li>Garnish: Fresh onion rings (white or red) and fresh chili.</li>
                    <li>Optional Flavor Enhancers: A dash of soy sauce, a squeeze of lemon/tamarind juice, or a dusting of Suya spice (Yaji) for added depth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>STEPS</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare the Meat: Cut the meat into thin strips. If time permits, marinate it with the ground ginger, minced garlic, salt, and pepper for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate.</li>
                        <li>Fire up the Grill: Prepare a charcoal grill until the coals are glowing hot. Michopo relies on the high heat and smoke of an open flame for its signature "charred perfection".</li>
                        <li>Roast/Grill: Place the meat strips directly on the grill. Cook, turning frequently, until the meat is tender and has developed a dark, smoky crust.</li>
                        <li>Finish: Once fully cooked, toss the meat with fresh onion rings while it is still hot. This lightly softens the onions and infuses the meat with their flavor.</li>
                        <li>Serve: Traditionally served hot, wrapped in newspaper or a takeaway pack, often accompanied by extra salt, chili, and a cold beverage like Mosi beer. For a full meal, it is best served with Nshima.</li>
                    </ol>
